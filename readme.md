[Whatever needs to be said about how the site works.]

## History
The store was created to meet the requirements of a project assignment in a Per Scholas software engineering boot camp.  Knowing that I had to create a store, I quickly decided that it would be a bookstore, because I like bookstores and this is probably as close as I'll ever get to owning one.  And since I'm always trying to get people to read the Dortmunder novels by Donald E. Westlake, I thought it would be fun to make my bookstore a kind of fan site for that series.
